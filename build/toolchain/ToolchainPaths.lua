Some non-configure based installations (eg Lua and Shellfire) can only use relative paths for things like libdir. They can probably use '..' but will need patching
	-- For shellfire applications, though, there isn't really any need to install
- Homebrew installs to say /usr/local/Cellar/make/4.1, then creates helpful symlinks from /usr/local (the sysroot)
	- We could do something similar, but with a file listing which version is the 'default' (this can be done using a pattern match, eg 4.1-customs/dep-hashes might be matched by 4.*-*/*; multiple matches result in 'longest' file name winning. Not good for RC1 releases, perhaps, but means dot-releases and debug builds take priority)
- We might like to explore not having lib, bin, etc inside the package folder, so we can split out a noexec filesystem (and potentially also optional docs, headers, etc)
	- In essence, only /bin needs to be executable
	- We could hardlink into an /opt/bin, say, then delete the original /opt/package/version/bin
		- This works for all applications bar those that do relative discovery of their libraries / files (which is quite rare, but is what shellfire does and is what Lua does)
	- We could have subfolders under /opt/bin, eg /opt/bin/package/version/bin - that prevents collision
	- There are a very small number of version-resistant programs that need to be in well-known locations
		- /usr/bin/env [versioning almost inconsequential, as it never needs to change]
		- /bin/sh & /usr/bin/sh [a common assumption] [versioning almost inconsequential now if using dash or ash; slight issue if using busybox sh; big issue if using bash in POSIX mode]
		- /bin/bash [a common assumption]; versioning breaks lots of things
		- Lua (5.1 vs 5.2 vs 5.3)
		- Python (2.7 vs 3)
	- There are also limitations on how complex we can make PATH
		- Some scripts reset PATH (not unreasonably)
		- So follow the hombrew approach
		- We can also install binaries with a version-suffix
	- So we need a 'default' version of every program
	- Each package can be given a range of 100 group ids to use (or it could use extended groups)
		- Programs can belong to one of these groups


sysrootPath			eg /  or  /opt/readonly
versionRelativePath	eg package/version-variants/dependencies such as make/4.1-custom/hash
prefixPath			eg /opt/readonly  (for share, var, etc)
execPrefixPath		eg /opt/executable  (for bin, sbin and libexec [and potentially lib]); also for any block or character devices (will be mounted nosuid)
libPrefixPath		defaults to prefixPath; exists because it is debateable whether libraries should go under prefixPath or execPrefixPath (GNU ./configure's preference, but this makes having a readonly /usr/lib, say, impossible. Traditionally .so libs could be executable but in practice never are used this way)
Note that it is still possible to run scripts from a filesystem mounted noexec
