-- Similar to halimede.createNamedCallableFunction, but has to work on existing module
assert.globalTypeIsFunction('getmetatable')
function modulefunction(functor)
	local metatable = getmetatable(module)
	metatable.__call = functor
	metatable.__tostring = function()
		return 'modulefunction ' .. functionName
